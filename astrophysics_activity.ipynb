    "In addition to the stochastic background, we expect a number of closer, louder sources to stand out to us. These are high-mass, inspiraling black hole binaries with orbital frequencies around $10^{-8}$ Hz. Their orbital frequency evolves too fast for the binary to contribute significantly to the stochastic background, but, relative to a typical human lifespan, it evolves very little. As such, we term these signals \"continuous gravitational waves\" since PTA experiments don't witness these binaries changing in orbital frequency. \n",

    "Some of these potential CW sources are close and bright enough to be observed electromagnetically. Optical and X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei and quasars can indicate if a galaxy has a black hole at the center large enough for us to detect. We can use this supplemental astronomical data to inform our searches, giving the search pipeline a heads up about where a signal might be lurking. The information goes both ways, too. By achieveing upper limits from our latest dataset we've been able to make statements about the kinds of binaries which are definitely not present in our data, which in turn constrains the mass, frequency, etc. of the candidate binaries astronomers are also interested in.\n",

    "In this exercise, we begin by looking at a continuous wave signal injected into some simulated pulsar timing data. First, we inspect the residuals by eye and do some quick estimates to give us an idea of how the injected signal gets jumbled. And then we run a full MCMC to see how much more information we can recover. Lastly, our results will be used to estimate some properties of the binary and it's host galaxy."
