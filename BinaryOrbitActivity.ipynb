This quantity is interesting because it allows us to make an (indirect!) estimate of the masses of the system from measurements of the Keplerian parameters.

This assumption is a lot less safe, since we know of binary systems that have very low inclinations, but it ends up giving us a lower limit of $m_{\\rm c}$ when assuming a value for $m_{\\rm p}$.
